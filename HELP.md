### Using Trigger Hotkey by ID

To use this feature, make sure you have obs-websocket 4.9.0 or greater installed. See the download link above to install the latest version.

- In OBS > Preferences > Hotkeys, assign a Hotkey to your desired actions and then click "Apply"
- In the OBS > Profile menu, select "Export" and choose a location. Click "Save"
- In the folder saved by OBS, open the **basic.ini** file in a text editor
- This file should have a section labeled **[Hotkeys]**. Under that section, the left most text up until the equals sign is the Hotkey ID. For example, a Hotkey ID might look like: **OBSBasic.StartRecording**
- Enter this value into the your Trigger hotkey by ID action in Companion

_Note:_ if you have scene-specific hotkeys, those Hotkey IDs are stored in a different file. To access those:

- In the OBS > Scene Collection menu, select "Export" and choose a location. Click "Save"
- Open the _SceneName_ **.json** file in a text editor
- This file will have multiple sections labeled **"hotkeys": {}**. It is likely easiest to use the search function to find them. Under each Hotkey section, the text contained within the quotes above the "key" is the Hotkey ID. For example, a Hotkey ID might look like: **OBSBasic.SelectScene**
- Enter this value into the your Trigger hotkey by ID action in Companion
